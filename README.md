## Results
- Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Through analysis of charted data, launching Theater Campaigns in May was the most succesful Month, followed by June and July. It is recomended that client launches future Theater Campaigns during the late spring and summer months to achieve the most sucessful goal outcomes.


- Outcomes based on Goals
Through analysis of charted data, campaigns in the (less than $1,000) and ($1,000 to $4,999) goals were the most sucessful in reaching a successful outcome of 76%.  Followed by campaigns in the ($35,000 to $39,999) and ($40,000 to $44,999) goals at a 67% success outcome.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations of this data set include a potential lack of reliable data such as self-repoting data.  Recomendations for future analysis would be having a 3rd party gather the data to ensure data reliability.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Recomended further analysis of Failed Outcomes, which made up 36% of outcomes, recomend analysis of Staff Pick and Spotlight (True vs False).
