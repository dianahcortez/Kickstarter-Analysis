# Kickstarter-Analysis
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Client presented with a data set of campaigns needing to be analyzed in their relation to launch dates and fundraising goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide visualization to the client on outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis
Excel was utilized as the primary software to analyze and visualize data.  Specifically used pivot tables, data sorting and line charts to visualize findings.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges experienced were scrubbing the formulas to make sure any potential errors were caught and corrected. 

## Results
- Outcomes based on launch date:
Through analysis of charted data, launching theater campaigns in May was the most successful month, followed by June and July. It is recommended that client launches future theater campaigns during the late spring and summer months to achieve the most successful goal outcomes.


- Outcomes based on goals:
Through analysis of charted data, campaigns in the (less than $1,000) and ($1,000 to $4,999) goals were the most successful in reaching a successful outcome of 76%.  Followed by campaigns in the ($35,000 to $39,999) and ($40,000 to $44,999) goals at a 67% success outcome.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations of this data set include a potential lack of reliable data such as self-reporting data.  Recommendations for future analysis would be having a 3rd party gather the data to ensure data reliability.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Recommend further analysis of failed outcomes, which made up 36% of outcomes, recommended analysis of staff pick and spotlight (True vs False).
